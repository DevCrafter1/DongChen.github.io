I am a second-year graduate student at the School of Computer Science at Sun Yat-sen University. My research interests include speech synthesis and synthetic speech identification.

I am lucky to be mentored by Professor Kun Zeng from the Software Institute of the School of Computer Science at Sun Yat-sen University.
